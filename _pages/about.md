I am currently an undergraduate student in the Department of Computer Science at Rutgers University where I am extremely fortunate to be advised by [Sepehr Assadi](https://sepehr.assadi.info/). This past summer, I had the privilege of interning under [Ching-An Cheng](https://www.chinganc.com/) at Microsoft Research. This fall, I will begin my PhD in the Department of Computer Science at Carnegie Mellon University. 

I am broadly interested in theoretical computer science. More specifically, I have been working on sublinear algorithms and machine learning theory. 

I am also passionate about teaching and increasing diversity within CS. I am currently / have been a TA and LA for the Computer Algorithms, Data Structures, and Intro to CS courses at Rutgers University. Please feel free to email me to chat!
