I am currently a first-year Ph.D. student in the Computer Science Department at Carnegie Mellon University where I am fortunate to be co-advised by [Richard Peng](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~yangp/) and [David Woodruff](http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~dwoodruf/). Previously, I was an undergraduate student at Rutgers University where I was fortunate to be advised by [Sepehr Assadi](https://sepehr.assadi.info/). I also had the privilege of interning with [Ching-An Cheng](https://www.chinganc.com/) at Microsoft Research in the summer of 2022. I will be supported by a NSF Graduate Research Fellowship. 

My research interests lie in theoretical computer science. In particular, I am thinking about:
* sublinear algorithms (streaming, sketching, sublinear-time)
* communication complexity (for streaming lower bounds)
* graph algorithms (graph sparsification, linear system solving)

I am also passionate about teaching and increasing diversity within CS. I have been a head LA, LA, and TA for various CS courses.
