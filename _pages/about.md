I am currently an undergraduate student in the Department of Computer Science at Rutgers University. I am super fortunate to be working under the direction of [Sepehr Assadi](https://sepehr.assadi.info/). This past summer, I was extremely fortunate to intern under [Ching-An Cheng](https://www.chinganc.com/) at Microsoft Research. This fall, I will begin my PhD in the Department of Computer Science at Carnegie Mellon University. 

My main research interests are broadly in the design and analysis of algorithms and complexity theory. More specifically, I have been working on big data algorithms in the sublinear time and streaming settings. I also have interests in algorithmic game theory and machine learning theory. 

I am also very passionate about teaching and increasing diversity within CS. I am currently a teaching assistant for the Computer Algorithms course and a learning assistant for the Data Structures course at Rutgers University. I was previously the head learning assistant for Data Structures and an LA for the Introduction to CS course.  Please feel free to email me to chat!
