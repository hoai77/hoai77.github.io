I am currently a first-year Ph.D. student in the Computer Science Department at Carnegie Mellon University where I am fortunate to be co-advised by [Richard Peng](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~yangp/) and [David Woodruff](http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~dwoodruf/). Previously, I was an undergraduate student at Rutgers University where I was fortunate to be advised by [Sepehr Assadi](https://sepehr.assadi.info/). I also had the privilege of interning with [Ching-An Cheng](https://www.chinganc.com/) at Microsoft Research in the summer of 2022. 

My primary research interests include the design and analysis of algorithms and complexity theory. I have been working on designing sublinear algorithms and establishing lower bounds in models motivated by big data such as sublinear-time and streaming. Currently, I am exploring streaming algorithms for optimization objectives. More broadly, I am also interested in machine learning theory, graph algorithms, and communication complexity.

I am also passionate about teaching and increasing diversity within CS. I have been a TA, LA, and head LA for the Computer Algorithms, Data Structures, and Intro to CS courses at Rutgers University. Please feel free to email me to chat!
